# Dimensionality-Reduction-PCA-versus-Autoencoders
In this project, we explore the techniques of dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders (AE). Dimensionality reduction is a crucial step in data preprocessing, enabling us to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data while reducing computational complexity.
